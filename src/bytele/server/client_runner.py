            self.config: Creates an instance of the Config class in ``server_config.py``. That file stores values that
            are used by the client_runner and visualizer_runner. Use that file to change the values, and **DO NOT**
            change them in any other file.

            self.total_number_of_games: An int representing the number of games to run during a tournament.

            self.number_of_unique_games: An int representing the unique number of combinations of clients to match them
            against each other.

            self.index_to_seed_id: Maps a seed index to a database seed_id.

            self.job_queues: A list of Queue objects to handle computations in threads. This helps improve the
            performance of running clients against each other. Without this, tournaments would be significantly slower.

            self.version: The version number of the project.

            self.best_run_for_client: A dict that contains the information of the best performance of a client.

            self.runner_temp_dir: A string representing the directory path to place the runner_temp folder.

            self.seed_path: A string representing the directory path used to place the ``seeds`` file in the runner_temp
            folder.

            self.total_number_of_games_for_one_client: An int representing the number of times a client will run against
            the opponents.

            self.tournament: This will either be an int to represent the tournament_id that can be accessed from the
