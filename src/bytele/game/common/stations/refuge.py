        'Refuge Class Notes'

        The Refuge Station is a one-tile zone where the player can hide from the bots for a set number of turns.
        While within the Refuge, the following occurs:
            - the player's passive point generation each turn is halted
            - bots can no longer scan the player's location, reducing them to randomized pathfinding
            - a passive countdown starts that boots the player from the refuge upon hitting 0 to prevent excessive camping
            - boot countdown resets after a certain number of turns. all refuges share the same boot countdown

        The Refuge is intended to add a layer of strategy to the game, providing safety at the cost of valuable points

        The occupied/turns_inside variables are meant to be global because their status can
                                        drastically change the state and operations of the entire game
