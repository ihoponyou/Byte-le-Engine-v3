    `Interact Controller Notes:`

        The Interact Controller manages the actions the player tries to execute. As the game is played, a player can
        interact with surrounding, adjacent stations and the space they're currently standing on.

        Example:
        ::
            x x x x x x
            x         x
            x   O     x
            x O A O   x
            x   O     x
            x x x x x x

        The given visual shows what players can interact with. "A" represents the avatar; "O" represents the spaces
        that can be interacted with (including where the "A" is); and "x" represents the walls and map border.

        These interactions are managed by using the provided ActionType enums in the enums.py file.
