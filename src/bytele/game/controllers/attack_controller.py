`Attack Controller Notes:`

    The Attack Controller manages the actions the bots try to execute. As the game is played, a bot can
    attack a surrounding player, adjacent stations from where they are currently positioned. For the jumping bot
    they are able to attack the diagonal stations from where they are currently positioned and when boosted both
    the diagonal stations and the adjacent stations from where they are currently positioned.

    Example:
    ::  Normal Bots    Jumper Boost   Jumper Norm
        x x x x x x    x x x x x x    x x x x x x
        x         x    x         x    x         x
        x   O     x    x  O O O  x    x O   P   x
        x O B P   x    x  0 B P  x    x   B     x

        x x x x x x    x x x x x x    x x x x x x

    The given visual shows what bots can interact with. "B represents the bot; "P" represents the player; "O"\
    represents the spaces that can be interacted with (including where the "P" and "B" is); and
    "x" represents the walls and map border.

    These interactions are managed by using the provided ActionType enums in the enums.py file.
